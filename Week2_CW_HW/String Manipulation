1. 
Accessing Characters


You can access characters using indexing (starts from 0):

text = "Hello"
print(text[0])   # Output: H
print(text[-1])  # Output: o (last character)
ðŸ”¹ 2. 
Slicing Strings


You can get a part of a string using slicing:

text = "Python"
print(text[0:3])   # Output: Pyt (from index 0 up to 3, not including 3)
print(text[2:])    # Output: thon (from index 2 to end)

String Methods


Python has many built-in string methods:

Example

.lower()

.upper()

.strip()

"  text  ".strip() â†’ "text"

.replace(a, b)

Replaces a with b

"blue sky".replace("blue", "red") â†’ "red sky"

.find(substring)

Returns index of first occurrence

"banana".find("na") â†’ 2

.split()

Splits into a list

"a,b,c".split(",") â†’ ['a','b','c']

.join()

String Concatenation


You can combine strings using +:

first = "Good"
second = "Morning"
result = first + " " + second
print(result)  # Output: Good Morning
ðŸ”¹ 5. 
Using f-strings (String Formatting)


This makes inserting variables into strings easy:

name = "Ali"
age = 16
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
# Output: My name is Ali and I am 16 years old.
