Control Flow in Python


Control flow lets your program make decisions and repeat actions.

📌 
if
 Statement


Used to make decisions.

age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("You are too young to vote.")


# Program to check if a number is even or odd
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
print(f"{number} is even")
else:
print(f"{number} is odd")



🔁 for Loop

Used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.

for i in range(5):
    print("Hello!")  # Prints "Hello!" five times


# Program to print multiplication table of a number
number = int(input("Enter a number for its multiplication table: "))
print(f"Multiplication table of {number}:")
for i in range(1, 11):
print(f"{number} x {i} = {number*i}")



🔁 while Loop


Repeats code as long as a condition is true.

count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Counting:", count)
    count += 1
