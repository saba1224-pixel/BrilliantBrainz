Fibonacci Series


ğŸ“š What is the Fibonacci Series?


The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where:

The first two numbers are 0 and 1.

Each number after that is the sum of the two previous numbers.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...


# Generate Fibonacci numbers between 1 and 50 using a for loop

# Step 1: Set the first two numbers
first = 0
second = 1

# Step 2: Use a for loop to generate numbers
for i in range(20): # Limit iterations to avoid infinite loop
next_number = first + second # Add the last two numbers

# Move the numbers one step forward
first = second
second = next_number

# Print only if in range 1 to 50
if next_number >= 1 and next_number <= 50:
print(next_number)


####  Your Task  #####

1) Make a table for the values of varaible first, second, next_number 
Hint:
Iteration     first    second    next_number
1              0        1        1
2              1        1        2      
3              1        2        3

2) What is the minimum range values we can give, instead of 20.
